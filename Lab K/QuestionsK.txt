1) Why are the times for the last 2 instructions 30 and 60 rather than #20 and #30?
This is because #20 and #30 before instruction is used as a delay to the current instruction value.
So the counters would need to have value of #10 to make it show 20 and 30 in the output.

2) Why did the program fail to capture the output of the circuit?
The reason being is because assignined inputs of different logic gates cannot be sematically correct. That is why when the code is run, the outout is 0.

3)What happens if the user forgot to specify one or more of the needed arguments?
There would a  compiler error as a has no value

4)Is it possible to detect if one or more of the needed arguemnts is missing?
If a is missing, then there will be a conditional statement saying if a ==0 then display a message saying a has no value and the same for any other arguments.
